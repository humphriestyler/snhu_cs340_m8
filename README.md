SNHU CS340 Python DASH Application

1. How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

One of the best ways to write maintainable, readable, and adaptable programs is to incorporate good coding standards such as syntax and style consistency. If your code looks the same, for lack of a better term, it will be more readable. Another easy way to make programs more readable is to include in-line comments and block comments, such as JavaDocs. These comments help other coders understand what a particular line of code or function does and how it interacts with the remainder of the program. The particular CRUD Python module in the future could be used in other databases aside from the AAC database, and could even be used in an external program such as a company's personal application that tracks inventory and warehouse items.


2. How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

To approach a problem as a computer scientist, one must first understand the problem. This includes reading existing code, interviewing clients, and creating graphical designs of the problem and its solution. My personal approach to Project Two differed from other courses because I was provided a clear requirement from the client, Grazioso Salvare, that explained what they planned to achieve with the program and some examples of what they wished to see. Other techniques I would have used, had I not been given the requirements already, would have been creating pseudocode that explained what the program would do and the various different types of queries the client required.

3. What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

Computer scientists are professionals who use computers and their wide variety of activities to solve real-world problems. These activities include algorithms, data structures, applications, and others. Real-world problems can be solved using computers, as present in Project Two's objectives. In that instance, a company needed a framework to conduct quick queries to filter information in a database, which was achieved by building a Python CRUD dashboard.
